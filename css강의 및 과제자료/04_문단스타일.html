        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
        Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
        Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
        보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        누구보다도
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
        I don't like that
        Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
        You're the top, babe
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        누구보다도
        You don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)
        Do you? (Make you mine, make you mine)
        You don't even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)
        Do you? (But I'm super shy, I'm super shy)
