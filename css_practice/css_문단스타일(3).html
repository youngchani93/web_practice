        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
        Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
        Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
        보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        You don't even know my name, do you?
        누구보다도

        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
        I don't like that
        Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
        You're the top, babe
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
